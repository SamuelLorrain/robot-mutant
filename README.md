# Robot Mutant

Robot Mutant is a tactical rpg style game I made to learn
about video game programming.

Is uses very few dependencies, as the frontend has been made
in plain `typescript` and `canvas API`.

All graphics are also home-made with `Aseprite`.

It's still work in progress. It should include a backend
soon.


# Usage
